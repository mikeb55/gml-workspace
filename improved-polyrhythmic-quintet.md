# Improved Polyrhythmic Quintet Architecture

## Key Improvements Needed:

1. **Harmonic Foundation**
   - Use chord progressions from Quintet
   - Apply polyrhythms to chord tones, not random notes

2. **Practical Polyrhythms**
   - Limit to one polyrhythmic layer at a time
   - Keep bass simple (quarter notes) for stability
   - Use polyrhythms for color, not chaos

3. **Instrument Roles**
   - Guitar: Chord comping with occasional polyrhythmic flourishes
   - Violin I: Melody with tuplet variations
   - Violin II: Harmonic support
   - Viola: Counter-melody
   - Cello/Bass: Rhythmic foundation

4. **Structure**
   - Measures 1-4: Establish groove
   - Measures 5-8: Introduce polyrhythm in one voice
   - Measures 9-12: Build complexity
   - Keep at least one voice rhythmically simple as anchor

## Implementation Plan:
1. Merge Quintet's harmonic engine with TriadGen's rhythm engine
2. Add polyrhythm selector (none, 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 7:4)
3. Assign polyrhythms to specific voices, not all
4. Maintain harmonic clarity throughout
