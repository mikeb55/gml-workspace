# GML Fretboard Projection Layer

## What This Layer Does

The Fretboard Projection Layer is a **pure mapping system** that takes voicings from the harmonic engine and decides **where** those notes appear on the guitar fretboard. It maps MIDI note numbers to specific strings and frets, creating a visual representation that feels calm, intentional, and guitarist-realistic.

Think of it like a translator: the harmonic engine speaks in "musical notes" (MIDI numbers), and this layer translates those into "guitar positions" (which string, which fret).

## What This Layer Does NOT Do

- ❌ **Never decides harmony** - It doesn't choose chords or voicings
- ❌ **Never alters voicings** - It accepts voicings as read-only truth from the engine
- ❌ **Never changes notes** - It only decides WHERE notes appear, not WHAT notes appear
- ❌ **No UI rendering** - This is pure logic, no visual output
- ❌ **No audio** - This is about position, not sound

## How It Relates to gml-harmonic-engine

This layer **consumes** output from `gml-harmonic-engine`:

1. The harmonic engine decides **what notes** to play (voicings)
2. The harmonic engine decides **when to hold** chords (HOLD signals)
3. The harmonic engine decides **register position** (low/mid/high)
4. **This layer** decides **where on the fretboard** those notes appear

The relationship is one-way: engine → projection. The projection layer never talks back to the engine.

## Example: Input → Output Mapping

### Input (from engine):
```javascript
{
  voicing: [48, 52, 55, 59],        // Cmaj7 (MIDI notes)
  inversion: 'root',
  registerPosition: 'mid',
  hold: false,
  reasonCodes: [{ code: 'BARRY_HARRIS_INVERSION' }]
}
```

### Output (from projection):
```javascript
{
  stringSet: [6, 5, 4, 3],          // Which strings to use
  frets: [3, null, null, null, null, null],  // Fret positions (string 6 = fret 3, etc.)
  positionWindow: [3, 8],           // Current position range
  anchorFret: 3,                     // Lowest fret used
  movementType: 'RESET',             // HOLD | STEP | RESET
  shapeId: 'root',                   // Preserved from engine
  registerBand: 'mid'                // Preserved from engine
}
```

### What This Means:
- The C note (MIDI 48) appears on string 6, fret 3
- The E note (MIDI 52) appears on string 5, fret 2
- The G note (MIDI 55) appears on string 4, fret 5
- The B note (MIDI 59) appears on string 3, fret 4
- All notes are within a 5-fret span (playable with one hand position)

## Visual Philosophy: Labyrinth-Style Calm

The projection layer is designed to create **calm, intentional movement** on the fretboard:

- **HOLD = Visual Stillness**: When the engine says "hold this chord," the fretboard doesn't move. Same strings, same frets, complete stillness.

- **STEP = Minimal Movement**: Small, intentional changes. One finger moves, or two. The hand position shifts slightly. Nothing jarring.

- **RESET = Single Intentional Jump**: When a big change is needed (register reset, major position change), it happens once, cleanly. No gradual drift, no wandering.

- **Position Window**: The layer maintains a "comfort zone" on the fretboard. It prefers to stay in this zone, only leaving when necessary.

- **Shape Continuity**: When possible, similar chord shapes use similar string sets. This creates visual patterns that feel natural to a guitarist.

## Core Behaviors

### 1. HOLD = Visual Stillness
If `hold === true`, the projection reuses the previous mapping exactly. No movement, no change. Complete visual stillness.

### 2. Position-First Logic
The layer maintains a current "position window" (a range of frets). It prefers to map notes within this window, only leaving when impossible or when a RESET is required.

### 3. Shape Continuity
- Prefers the same `shapeId` (inversion type)
- Prefers the same string set
- Prefers minimal fret movement

### 4. String Set Priority
The layer tries string sets in this order:
1. `[6, 5, 4, 3]` - Low strings (bass-heavy)
2. `[5, 4, 3, 2]` - Mid-low strings (balanced)
3. `[4, 3, 2, 1]` - Mid-high strings (treble-heavy)
4. Mixed sets only if unavoidable

### 5. Minimal Movement
- Changes one note if possible
- Avoids string jumps
- STEP preferred over RESET

### 6. Register Reset
When the engine signals a register reset (or the layer detects a major register change), it performs a single, intentional jump. No gradual drift.

## Technical Details

### Input Format
Each chord from the engine provides:
- `voicing`: Array of MIDI note numbers (ordered)
- `inversion`: String ('root', 'first', 'second', 'third') → becomes `shapeId`
- `registerPosition`: String ('low', 'mid', 'high') → becomes `registerBand`
- `hold`: Boolean (if true, reuse previous mapping)
- `reasonCodes`: Array of explanation objects from engine

### Output Format
Each projection result provides:
- `stringSet`: Array of string numbers used (1-6, where 6 is low E)
- `frets`: Array of 6 fret positions (null = string not used)
- `positionWindow`: `[minFret, maxFret]` - current position range
- `anchorFret`: Lowest fret used in this mapping
- `movementType`: 'HOLD' | 'STEP' | 'RESET'
- `shapeId`: Preserved from engine input
- `registerBand`: Preserved from engine input

### Constraints
- Maximum fret span: 5 frets (playable with one hand position)
- Maximum fret: 20 (reasonable upper limit)
- Standard tuning: EADGBE (MIDI 40, 45, 50, 55, 59, 64)

## Usage

```javascript
import { FretboardProjection } from './src/fretboard-projection-v0.1.3.js';

const projection = new FretboardProjection();

// Process a chord from the engine
const engineOutput = {
  voicing: [48, 52, 55, 59],
  inversion: 'root',
  registerPosition: 'mid',
  hold: false,
  reasonCodes: []
};

const fretboardMapping = projection.project(engineOutput);

console.log(fretboardMapping);
// {
//   stringSet: [6, 5, 4, 3],
//   frets: [3, 2, 5, 4, null, null],
//   positionWindow: [3, 8],
//   anchorFret: 3,
//   movementType: 'RESET',
//   shapeId: 'root',
//   registerBand: 'mid'
// }
```

## Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run version-specific tests:
```bash
npm run test:v0.1.0
npm run test:v0.1.1
npm run test:v0.1.2
npm run test:v0.1.3
```

Each version has 40+ test cycles covering:
- Basic projection functionality
- HOLD behavior
- STEP vs RESET detection
- Long-form stability (32-64 bars)
- Register reset scenarios
- Shape continuity
- Position window management
