# Quintile Engine v2.0 - Specification (PLACEHOLDER)

## Status
**NOT IMPLEMENTED** - This is a placeholder for future development.

## Purpose
Add quintile (5th-based) harmony system as a separate engine from the Quartal Engine.

## Version
**v2.0 (New Harmonic Family - Quintile Engine)**

## Design Principles
- Separate engine from Quartal Engine (v1.x)
- Keeps v1.x intact and unchanged
- Uses quintile stacking (n, n+4, n+7, optional n+11) instead of quartal
- Same MusicXML output format
- Same guitar constraints
- Same deterministic requirements

## Implementation Notes
- This will be implemented as a separate system when requested
- Will have its own spec, prompt, and generator files
- Will not modify or affect v1.x behavior
